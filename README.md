# H7_NCSManagementSystem
Olah!
I and other 3 team-mates made this project.

There is NCS -National Competency Standards- in my country, Republic of Korea.
NCS is the standards made by the government, to confirm someone is qualified to a certain job.
And nowadays, many coorperates and universities are trying to adopt NCS to their system.

So, we created this program that is to do test about NCS and check the results.

It's developed to Spring Legacy Project -with STS and Oracle DB-.
I APPRICIATE to you interested in my repository!
Thx!
